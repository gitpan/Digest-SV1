README for Digest::SV1 version 0.01
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a pre-release version of the SV1 hash algorithm.

This version has not yet been tested on some important alternate

So, as a precaution, please be wary of using this module to produce

platform, please let me know ASAP on samv@cpan.org, or log a ticket in
rt.cpan.org.
